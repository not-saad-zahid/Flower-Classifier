# Flower Classifier

This project demonstrates image classification of flowers using deep learning models implemented in Jupyter Notebook. The objective is to accurately identify different species of flowers from images, providing an end-to-end workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## Features

- **Image Preprocessing:** Efficiently prepares and augments image data for training.
- **Deep Learning Model:** Utilizes neural networks for accurate flower classification.
- **Training & Evaluation:** Step-by-step guide to training the model, validating results, and analyzing performance.
- **Visualization:** Includes tools to visualize sample images, training progress, and prediction results.
- **Reproducible Notebooks:** All code, explanations, and outputs are contained within Jupyter Notebooks for interactive exploration.

## Technologies Used

- **Jupyter Notebook** – For interactive code, analysis, and visualization.
- **Python** – For data handling and model implementation (within notebooks).
- **TensorFlow / Keras or PyTorch** – For building and training neural networks.
- **NumPy, Matplotlib, and other libraries** – For data processing and visualization.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/not-saad-zahid/Flower-Classifier.git
    ```
2. Open the notebooks in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Follow the step-by-step instructions to train and test the flower classification model.

## Dataset

The project uses a flower image dataset, such as the popular [Flowers Recognition Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition) or similar. See the notebooks for download instructions and setup details.
